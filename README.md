MovieFlicks Demo
(Sample of your weekly project submission README)

This is an Android demo application for displaying the latest box office movies using the MovieFlicks API. See the RottenTomatoes Networking Tutorial on our cliffnotes for a step-by-step tutorial.

Time spent: 9 hours spent in total

Completed user stories:

 Required: In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
 Required: In landscape mode, the rotated layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.

Spent some time making the UI work across multiple phone resolutions by playing around with the RelativeLayout.
